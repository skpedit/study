| **Stage**                | **Objective**                                  | **Key Actions**                                                   | **Decision Points**                            | **Outcome**                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Needs Assessment**  | Identify the team's knowledge gaps and goals   | - Assess the team's current familiarity with BPMN, workflows, and Camunda. <br> - Identify key use cases the team will handle (e.g., automation, decision modeling). | Does the team have prior experience with BPM tools? | Tailor training content to specific needs.      |
| **2. Training Curriculum Design** | Develop a structured training program       | - Define modules: Basics (BPMN, Camunda), Advanced (APIs, plugins), and Practical Use Cases. <br> - Include hands-on exercises and real-world examples. | Are the modules aligned with team roles and objectives? | Create a detailed training roadmap.             |
| **3. Tool Setup and Access** | Ensure team members can access Camunda tools | - Provide access to the Camunda Modeler, Cockpit, Tasklist, and Optimize. <br> - Set up a sandbox environment for practice. | Are all tools and environments ready for use? | Enable seamless access and ensure readiness.    |
| **4. Hands-On Workshops** | Facilitate interactive learning experiences    | - Conduct workshops on building workflows, decision tables, and handling human tasks. <br> - Use real project examples for context. | Are participants actively engaging and completing exercises? | Ensure practical understanding of key features. |
| **5. Progress Assessment** | Evaluate the team's learning and readiness     | - Use quizzes, assignments, and feedback sessions to gauge understanding. <br> - Identify areas needing reinforcement. | Are team members meeting training benchmarks? | Address gaps with targeted follow-ups.          |
| **6. Certification and Resources** | Validate team readiness and provide ongoing support | - Offer completion certificates for the training. <br> - Share documentation, cheat sheets, and links to Camunda community resources. | Do team members feel confident to use Camunda? | Empower team with skills and resources.         |
| **7. Post-Training Support** | Provide continued guidance and mentoring     | - Set up a helpdesk or Slack channel for ongoing queries. <br> - Encourage participation in the Camunda user community. | Are team members effectively applying Camunda? | Build confidence and foster self-sufficiency.   |

### **Common Challenges and Solutions**

| **Challenge**                       | **Cause**                                      | **Solution**                                     |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Overwhelmed Team Members**         | Complex topics introduced too quickly.         | Use a gradual approach and break content into smaller sessions. |
| **Lack of Practical Context**        | Training lacks relevance to real-world scenarios. | Incorporate examples from the teamâ€™s projects. |
| **Tool Access Issues**               | Technical setup not ready during training.     | Pre-configure environments and conduct setup checks beforehand. |
| **Retention of Knowledge**           | Forgetting concepts post-training.             | Provide post-training support and reference materials. |
