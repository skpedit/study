### **High-Level Table for Monitoring a Transaction Reconciliation Process and Resolving Stuck Workflows**

This table outlines the phases, objectives, and key actions for analyzing and monitoring a **transaction reconciliation process** and managing workflows that encounter bottlenecks or failures.

| **Phase**                | **Objective**                                    | **Key Actions**                                              | **Decision Points**                             | **Outcome**                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **1. Data Collection**   | Gather transactional data from all sources       | - Fetch data from systems (e.g., ERP, bank, payment gateway). <br> - Consolidate into a unified format. | Is data complete and consistent across sources? | Proceed to validation or request missing data.|
| **2. Data Validation**   | Verify accuracy and integrity of collected data  | - Check for duplicates, missing fields, or incorrect formats. <br> - Use automated rules for initial validation. | Does the data pass validation checks?          | Proceed to matching or flag discrepancies.    |
| **3. Transaction Matching** | Match transactions from source to destination  | - Pair debits and credits across systems. <br> - Identify mismatches (e.g., timing or amount discrepancies). | Are all transactions matched successfully?     | Proceed or flag for manual review.            |
| **4. Error Detection**   | Identify stuck or failed workflows               | - Monitor workflows for timeouts, exceptions, or rejections. <br> - Trigger alerts for unresolved issues. | Are workflows completed within SLAs?          | Escalate issues or rerun processes.           |
| **5. Resolution Handling** | Address mismatches and workflow errors          | - Investigate flagged transactions or stuck workflows. <br> - Resolve manually or rerun automated processes. | Can errors be resolved automatically?          | Resolve issues or escalate to stakeholders.   |
| **6. Reporting**         | Provide visibility into the reconciliation process| - Generate real-time dashboards and error summaries. <br> - Log resolved and unresolved issues for analysis. | Are issues logged and summarized effectively?  | Ensure compliance and continuous improvement. |

### **Key Analysis Metrics for Monitoring**
| **Metric**                              | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Match Rate**                          | Percentage of successfully matched transactions (e.g., "90% matched").         |
| **Error Rate**                          | Percentage of transactions flagged as erroneous (e.g., "5% with discrepancies").|
| **Resolution Time**                     | Average time taken to resolve mismatched transactions or stuck workflows.      |
| **Stuck Workflow Rate**                 | Percentage of workflows exceeding defined SLAs.                                |
| **System Latency**                      | Time taken for each stage of the reconciliation process.                       |

### **High-Level Workflow for Resolving Stuck Workflows**

| **Stage**                | **Action**                                              | **Tools/Methods**                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Detect**               | Identify stuck workflows using monitoring tools.       | Workflow monitoring dashboards, alerts. |
| **Diagnose**             | Analyze root causes (e.g., missing data, failed APIs). | Logs, error messages, debugging tools. |
| **Retry**                | Retry failed workflows if conditions are met.          | Workflow retry mechanisms.           |
| **Escalate**             | Escalate unresolved workflows to appropriate teams.    | Automated notifications, manual assignments. |
| **Resolve**              | Fix errors and ensure workflows proceed to completion. | Manual fixes, system updates, reruns. |

### **Common Challenges and Solutions**

| **Challenge**                     | **Cause**                                              | **Solution**                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Duplicate Transactions**        | System redundancies or reattempts by users.           | Deduplication checks during data validation.        |
| **Unmatched Transactions**        | Timing mismatches or incorrect data.                  | Time window adjustments, manual overrides.          |
| **Workflow Timeouts**             | Slow API responses or processing delays.              | Increase timeout limits, optimize processing logic. |
| **Data Inconsistencies**          | Data format or synchronization issues between systems.| Implement robust ETL processes and validation rules.|
