| **Stage**                | **Objective**                                       | **Key Actions**                                                | **Decision Points**                             | **Outcome**                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **1. Task Assignment**   | Assign the manual loan approval task to a reviewer | - Identify eligible reviewers based on workload and expertise. <br> - Notify the assigned reviewer through the tasklist system. | Is a qualified reviewer available?            | Assign task or escalate to another queue.     |
| **2. Review Documentation** | Ensure all required documents are present and valid | - Check documents flagged by the automated validation process (e.g., income proof, ID). <br> - Cross-verify with submission requirements. | Are all required documents in order?          | Proceed to eligibility checks or request more information. |
| **3. Financial Evaluation** | Assess applicant's financial metrics              | - Review income, debt-to-income ratio, and credit score. <br> - Check additional criteria like employment stability and collateral value. | Do financial metrics meet predefined thresholds? | Approve, escalate, or reject based on analysis. |
| **4. Compliance Verification** | Ensure compliance with lending policies          | - Verify adherence to internal and external regulations. <br> - Use checklist tools to validate compliance. | Are there compliance risks or rule violations? | Proceed or escalate for further review.      |
| **5. Decision Making**   | Make a decision based on manual evaluation         | - Approve the loan if all criteria are met. <br> - Reject the loan with clear reasons if criteria fail. | Is the decision final?                         | Mark task as completed or flag for escalation. |
| **6. Task Completion**   | Finalize and document the decision                 | - Log the decision (approval/rejection) with reasons. <br> - Notify stakeholders (e.g., applicant, system). | Has the decision been properly recorded?       | Close the task or send back for re-evaluation. |

### **Additional Considerations**

#### **Key Inputs for the Reviewer:**
1. Applicant profile (e.g., name, age, employment details).  
2. Automated validation results (e.g., flagged discrepancies).  
3. Supporting documents (e.g., bank statements, salary slips).  
4. Credit score and financial reports.

#### **Output from the Reviewer:**
1. Loan approval or rejection status.  
2. Detailed notes on decisions made (e.g., reasons for rejection).  
3. Updates to the workflow system (e.g., move to the disbursement phase or terminate).

### **Common Challenges and Solutions**
| **Challenge**                       | **Cause**                                           | **Solution**                                       |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Delayed Approvals**               | Reviewer backlog or unclear priorities.           | Implement SLA monitoring and task prioritization. |
| **Incomplete Documentation**        | Applicant fails to provide all required documents.| Enable a checklist system and pre-validation alerts. |
| **Inconsistent Decisions**          | Reviewers interpret guidelines differently.       | Use standardized decision-making frameworks or checklists. |
| **Regulatory Non-Compliance**       | Missing critical checks in the process.           | Integrate compliance tools into the review workflow. |

### **Monitoring and Reporting**
1. **Metrics to Track**:  
   - Average approval time per loan.  
   - Number of loans escalated or rejected.  
   - Task completion rate within SLA.  

2. **Dashboards and Alerts**:  
   - Real-time updates on pending approvals.  
   - Notifications for overdue tasks.
