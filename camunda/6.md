#### **1. SLA Adherence for Customer Service Processes**

| **Stage**                | **Objective**                                  | **Key Actions**                                                   | **Decision Points**                            | **Outcome**                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Data Collection**   | Gather data on service processes               | - Extract timestamps and logs for tickets, escalations, and resolutions. <br> - Consolidate SLA targets and metrics per service type. | Are all required data points available?        | Proceed or request missing data.                |
| **2. SLA Calculation**   | Measure SLA adherence                          | - Compare actual resolution times with SLA targets. <br> - Categorize tickets (e.g., met, breached, nearing breach). | Do processes meet SLA thresholds?             | Identify breaches and classify outcomes.         |
| **3. Trend Analysis**    | Identify patterns in SLA adherence             | - Group SLA breaches by factors like team, region, or time period. <br> - Detect recurring causes for missed SLAs. | Are there noticeable trends?                  | Generate insights or flag areas for improvement. |
| **4. Root Cause Analysis** | Pinpoint reasons for SLA breaches              | - Review escalation logs, resource allocation, and workload distribution. <br> - Use Pareto analysis for frequent issues. | Can root causes be identified?                | Suggest action plans to improve adherence.       |
| **5. Report Generation** | Present findings to stakeholders               | - Visualize SLA adherence metrics using dashboards and charts. <br> - Highlight areas of improvement and compliance trends. | Are findings actionable and understandable?    | Publish report for stakeholders.                 |

#### **Key Metrics for SLA Adherence Analysis**
1. **SLA Compliance Rate**: % of tickets resolved within SLA.  
2. **Average Resolution Time**: Time taken to resolve a ticket.  
3. **Breach Rate**: % of tickets breaching SLA targets.  
4. **Pending SLA Risk**: % of tickets nearing SLA breach.

#### **2. Evaluating Decision Table Outcomes Over Time**

| **Stage**                | **Objective**                                  | **Key Actions**                                                   | **Decision Points**                            | **Outcome**                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Rule Execution Data** | Gather data on decision table rule outcomes    | - Collect decision logs from automated workflows. <br> - Identify input parameters, rules triggered, and outputs. | Is decision log data complete and accurate?    | Proceed or identify missing logs.               |
| **2. Performance Metrics** | Measure the efficiency and accuracy of rules  | - Calculate hit rates for individual rules. <br> - Analyze success rates of decisions (e.g., correct approvals/rejections). | Are rules performing as expected?             | Identify underperforming or overused rules.      |
| **3. Impact Analysis**   | Evaluate the business impact of rule outcomes  | - Link decision outcomes to key KPIs (e.g., revenue, risk reduction). <br> - Identify downstream effects of decisions. | Do outcomes align with business objectives?    | Highlight beneficial or problematic rules.       |
| **4. Variance Analysis** | Detect deviations in rule outcomes over time   | - Compare historical trends in decision outcomes. <br> - Flag anomalies or changes in decision patterns. | Are deviations justified or problematic?       | Suggest rule modifications if needed.           |
| **5. Report Generation** | Share evaluation results with stakeholders     | - Summarize rule performance metrics. <br> - Provide actionable recommendations (e.g., refine rules or thresholds). | Are recommendations actionable and strategic?  | Publish report for business and technical teams. |

#### **Key Metrics for Decision Table Evaluation**
1. **Rule Hit Rate**: % of instances a rule is triggered.  
2. **Accuracy Rate**: % of correct decisions based on rule outcomes.  
3. **Anomaly Rate**: % of decisions deviating from expected patterns.  
4. **Impact on KPIs**: Effect of decisions on revenue, risk, or operations.

### **Common Challenges and Solutions**

| **Challenge**                  | **Cause**                                   | **Solution**                                      |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Gaps**                  | Missing or inconsistent data.               | Implement robust logging and monitoring tools.   |
| **Unclear Trends**             | Noise in data from unrelated factors.       | Use statistical methods to isolate meaningful patterns. |
| **Outdated SLA/Rules**         | SLA targets or decision rules no longer align with business needs. | Regularly review and update SLAs and rules.      |
| **Stakeholder Buy-In**         | Lack of actionable insights in reports.     | Focus reports on business impact and solutions.  |
