If one of your project's dependencies is causing this issue due to its reliance on `Intl.ListFormat`, you can address the problem with these approaches:

---

### **1. Update the Problematic Dependency**
- Check if the dependency causing the issue has a newer version that resolves compatibility with your environment.
- Update it using:
  ```bash
  npm update <package-name>
  ```

- If you’re unsure which dependency is causing the issue, use:
  ```bash
  npm ls @formatjs/ecma402-abstract
  ```
  This will show where `@formatjs/ecma402-abstract` is being used.

---

### **2. Use a Polyfill**
If the dependency cannot be updated and your environment does not support `Intl.ListFormat`, you can polyfill it:

1. Install the polyfill:
   ```bash
   npm install @formatjs/intl-listformat
   ```

2. Add the polyfill in your application's entry file (e.g., `index.ts` or `main.ts`):
   ```typescript
   import '@formatjs/intl-listformat/polyfill';
   import '@formatjs/intl-listformat/locale-data/en'; // Replace 'en' with your locale
   ```

This will ensure `Intl.ListFormat` is available at runtime.

---

### **3. Override `node_modules` Typings (Temporary Hack)**
You can temporarily override the dependency's code or typings to remove the problematic reference to `Intl.ListFormat`. 

1. Navigate to the file causing the issue:
   ```
   node_modules/@formatjs/ecma402-abstract/utils.d.ts
   ```

2. Modify the line:
   ```typescript
   export declare const createMemoizedListFormat: (...args: any[]) => any;
   ```

⚠️ This is not a recommended long-term solution, as the changes will be lost when reinstalling dependencies.

---

### **4. Shim `Intl.ListFormat` in Your Code**
If the dependency references `Intl.ListFormat`, provide a basic implementation in environments where it's missing:

1. Add this snippet in a global file (e.g., `polyfills.ts`):
   ```typescript
   if (!Intl.ListFormat) {
       (Intl as any).ListFormat = class {
           constructor(locales: string | string[], options: any) {}
           format(list: string[]): string {
               return list.join(', ');
           }
           formatToParts(list: string[]): any[] {
               return [{ type: 'element', value: list.join(', ') }];
           }
       };
   }
   ```

2. Import the polyfill in your entry file.

---

### **5. Ignore TypeScript Errors for the Dependency**
If you don't need `Intl.ListFormat` functionality but the TypeScript error blocks your build:

1. Use `skipLibCheck` in `tsconfig.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "skipLibCheck": true
     }
   }
   ```

   This will ignore type errors in `node_modules`.

---

### **6. Replace the Dependency**
If the dependency causing the problem cannot be resolved, consider using an alternative library that doesn’t rely on `Intl.ListFormat`.

---

### Debugging Tip:
- Use `npm ls <package>` to locate which dependency is importing the problematic package.
- If it's a transitive dependency, consider using `npm dedupe` to simplify the dependency tree:
  ```bash
  npm dedupe
  ```
