In Camunda BPM, when configuring multi-instance tasks, you're telling the engine to execute a task multiple times — either sequentially or in parallel — based on a collection of input data. Here's how to properly configure the multi-instance properties in Camunda Modeler:


---

Multi-Instance Properties (for a Task)

Property	Description	Example (FEEL Expression)

Input collection	The list of items that the task should iterate over. This is mandatory.	= order.items
Input element	The loop variable that refers to a single item in the collection.	item
Output collection	(Optional) A variable to collect results from each instance.	results
Output element	(Optional) A variable used to store the result of each task execution.	result
Completion condition	A FEEL expression that determines when to stop executing more instances.	= count(results) >= 3



---

Example Use Case

You want to assign a task to process each item in an order list. You expect:

Input: order.items

Loop variable: item

Result of each task execution: stored in result

All results collected in results

Task should stop once 3 results are collected.


You configure as:

Input collection: = order.items (FEEL expression required)

Input element: item

Output element: result

Output collection: results

Completion condition: = count(results) >= 3 (FEEL expression required)

Let me know if you need a specific BPMN XML example or want to see this in the context of a User Task, Service Task, or Call Activity.
