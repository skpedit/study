Sure! Here's a detailed description of each property/section typically found in a Service Task configuration in Camunda Modeler (especially when working with Camunda 8 or BPMN 2.0):


---

SERVICE TASK: “Send rejection notice”

This is the name or label of the service task in the BPMN model.


---

General

Basic task settings.

→ Documentation

Description of what the task does.

Helps developers or analysts understand its purpose.

Example: “This task sends an email to inform the user about rejection.”


→ Template

Optional pre-defined behavior or script (e.g., email, HTTP call).

You can select a template from a library (e.g., HTTP Connector, External Task Handler).



---

Details

Configuration related to task execution.

→ Task Definition

Defines the type and identifier of the task.

Type: Should match the job type expected by a worker (e.g., send-email).

Retries: Optional, how many times to retry on failure.



---

Inputs

Variables to pass into the task.

Format: Input Name → Variable or expression

Example: emailAddress → =customerEmail



---

Outputs

Maps task results to process variables.

Format: Output Name → Variable

Example: responseBody → emailStatus



---

Headers

Additional metadata passed to the worker.

Common in external task scenarios.

Example: priority → high



---

Execution Listeners

Hooks that trigger scripts or logic before/after the task starts or completes.

Useful for logging, auditing, or custom logic.



---

Extension Properties

Custom key-value pairs added for process-level metadata.

Can be used by workers, tools, or other systems.



---

Example Data

Usually for testing or simulation.

Predefined input/output values to see how the task behaves during development or testing.

Sure! Below is a JSON-style representation of a Camunda Service Task configuration for "Send rejection notice", mapping the properties you asked about. This is a conceptual structure, typically used in modelers or exported BPMN representations.

  "documentation": "This task sends an email to notify the user of the rejection status.",
  "taskDefinition": {
    "type": "send-email",
    "retries": 3
  },
  "template": "email-connector",

  }
}

Notes:

This JSON structure is not directly used in Camunda 8 Modeler but is a conceptual format for understanding the properties.

Actual execution depends on how Camunda's job workers are configured (e.g., via connectors, external task clients).

In real deployment, you typically model this in BPMN XML, and workers consume jobs via their respective SDKs.


Would you like the actual BPMN XML snippet for this task too?
