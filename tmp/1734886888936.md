To send content to GitHub via API and commit a file, you'll typically need to use the **GitHub REST API**. Specifically, you will use the [Create or update a file](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-or-update-file-contents) API endpoint to create or update a file in a repository.

Here's a general guide to how you can achieve this:

### Steps to Commit a File via GitHub API

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)**:  
   To authenticate with the GitHub API, you need a personal access token. You can generate one by going to [GitHub's token page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and creating a token with the necessary permissions (`repo` scope).

2. **Make an API Request**:  
   You will make a `PUT` request to GitHub's API to commit a file. The URL for the request will be in the format:

   ```
   PUT https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}
   ```

   - `{owner}`: The GitHub username or organization name.
   - `{repo}`: The name of the repository.
   - `{path}`: The path of the file within the repository.

3. **Request Body**:  
   The body of the request must contain the file content (encoded in base64), the commit message, and, if applicable, the SHA of the file if you're updating an existing file.

### Example Using `fetch` in JavaScript (or Angular):

Here is an example of how to send the file content and commit it to GitHub using the API.

```javascript
async function commitToGitHub(filePath, fileContent) {
    const repoOwner = 'your-username'; // Replace with your GitHub username
    const repoName = 'your-repo'; // Replace with your repository name
    const personalAccessToken = 'your-personal-access-token'; // Replace with your GitHub token

    const url = `https://api.github.com/repos/${repoOwner}/${repoName}/contents/${filePath}`;

    // Convert file content to Base64
    const encodedContent = btoa(fileContent); // Ensure `fileContent` is a UTF-8 string

    const data = {
        message: 'Commit message here', // Your commit message
        content: encodedContent,
        branch: 'main' // Specify the branch you're committing to
    };

    const response = await fetch(url, {
        method: 'PUT',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': `token ${personalAccessToken}`,
            'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    if (response.ok) {
        console.log('File committed successfully:', result);
    } else {
        console.error('Error committing file:', result);
    }
}

// Example usage:
const filePath = 'path/to/file.txt';
const fileContent = 'Hello, world!'; // Content to be committed
commitToGitHub(filePath, fileContent);
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base64 Encoding**: The `content` field in the API request must be base64-encoded. The `btoa()` function is used for encoding strings in base64, but it can only handle characters in the Latin1 range. If you have non-ASCII characters, ensure you first encode them with `encodeURIComponent()` and `unescape()` as needed.
   
   Example for handling non-ASCII characters:
   ```javascript
   const encodedContent = btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(fileContent)));
   ```

2. **Authentication**: The request uses a personal access token (`Authorization: token <your_token>`).

3. **Commit Message**: You provide a commit message to describe the changes you're making.

4. **Branch**: You can specify which branch you want the commit to go to. By default, this is usually the `main` branch, but you can specify a different branch if necessary.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Updating Files**: If the file already exists, youâ€™ll need to include the SHA of the existing file in the `sha` field. This will prevent accidental overwrites and ensure you're updating the correct file.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  const data = {
    message: 'Update file content',
    content: encodedContent,
    sha: 'existing-file-sha', // The SHA of the file being updated
    branch: 'main'
  };
  ```

- **Error Handling**: Always check for errors in the response, as GitHub may return an error if the file already exists, the path is incorrect, or your access token does not have the required permissions.

### Example of an API response:
```json
{
  "content": {
    "name": "file.txt",
    "path": "file.txt",
    "sha": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12",
    "size": 17,
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/your-repo/contents/file.txt?ref=main",
    "html_url": "https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/file.txt",
    "git_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/your-repo/git/blobs/abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12",
    "download_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/file.txt"
  },
  "commit": {
    "sha": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12",
    "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/your-username/your-repo/commits/abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12"
  }
}
```

This confirms that the file was successfully committed, and you can access it via the provided URL.
