To set up a GitHub workflow that generates pull request (PR) notifications and sends them to Microsoft Teams or other platforms, you can follow these steps:

---

### **1. Configure GitHub Workflow**

GitHub Actions allows you to create workflows for specific events like `pull_request`. Below is an example workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-notifications.yml`) to trigger when a pull request is opened, synchronized, or updated:

```yaml
name: PR Notification to Teams

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  notify-teams:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Send Notification to MS Teams
        uses: wei/curl@v1
        with:
          args: >
            -X POST
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
            -d '{"@type": "MessageCard", "themeColor": "0076D7", "title": "Pull Request Notification", "text": "A new pull request has been created.", "sections": [{"activityTitle": "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}", "activitySubtitle": "PR: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}", "facts": [{"name": "Author", "value": "${{ github.actor }}"}, {"name": "Branch", "value": "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}"}, {"name": "PR URL", "value": "[Link](${{ github.event.pull_request.html_url }})"}]}]}' 
            YOUR_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### **2. Step-by-Step Explanation**

#### **`on` Section**
- **`pull_request`**: Specifies that this workflow should trigger on pull request events.
- **`types`**: Defines which pull request events trigger the workflow:
  - `opened`: When a new PR is created.
  - `synchronize`: When commits are pushed to an open PR.
  - `reopened`: When a previously closed PR is reopened.

#### **`jobs` Section**
- **`runs-on`**: Specifies the type of machine to execute the job. Here, itâ€™s `ubuntu-latest`.
- **`steps`**: Lists the actions to perform in sequence.

#### **Send Notification**
- **`uses: wei/curl@v1`**: A GitHub Action that allows making HTTP requests using `curl`.
- **`args`**: Sends a POST request with a JSON payload to the Microsoft Teams webhook URL.

---

### **3. Setting Up Microsoft Teams Webhook**

1. **Create a Webhook in Microsoft Teams**:
   - Go to the desired channel in Microsoft Teams.
   - Click on the ellipsis (`...`) next to the channel name.
   - Select **Connectors** > **Incoming Webhook**.
   - Create and copy the generated webhook URL.

2. **Replace `YOUR_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`**:
   - Update the workflow file with the webhook URL you copied.

---

### **4. Customize the JSON Payload**

The JSON payload in the workflow sends a message to Microsoft Teams using the **MessageCard** format:

- **`title`**: Title of the notification (e.g., "Pull Request Notification").
- **`text`**: Main text content of the notification.
- **`sections`**: Contains additional details like repository name, PR title, branch, and author.
- **`facts`**: Key-value pairs for detailed information.

You can customize the structure to include more details or different formats.

---

### **5. Example Output in Microsoft Teams**
When a pull request is created, the message in Teams might look like this:

#### **PR Notification**
> **Pull Request Notification**  
> Repository: `user/repository`  
> PR: `Add new feature`  
> **Author**: `username`  
> **Branch**: `feature-branch`  
> **PR URL**: [Link to PR](https://github.com/user/repository/pull/123)

### **6. Expand to Other Platforms**
For other platforms like Slack, Discord, or email, modify the webhook URL and payload format to match their API requirements.
