Here’s a clear, organized breakdown of what a developer should **competently configure in Camunda 8 (Zeebe engine)** for BPMN processes, with relevant documentation references:
  
### **1. Task Types Configuration**
 
Configure the following tasks so they can be executed by Zeebe:
 
 
-  
**User Task** – For human interaction [User Tasks Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/user-tasks/)
 
 
-  
**Service Task** – For calling microservices or workers [Service Tasks Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/service-tasks/)
 
 
-  
**Send Task** – Used with message events (Zeebe-specific workaround often needed) *(Usually not separately modeled — use message events instead)*
 
 
-  
**Receive Task** – Can be replaced by **Intermediate Message Catch Event** [Message Events Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/events/message-events/)
 
 
-  
**Business Rule Task** – Triggers DMN decision tables [Business Rule Tasks Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/business-rule-tasks/)
 
 
-  
**Script Task** – Not natively supported in Zeebe; use Service Task with script logic in worker
 
 

  
### **2. Gateway Types Configuration**
 
 
-  
**Parallel Gateway** – All outgoing branches are taken [Parallel Gateway Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/gateways/parallel-gateway/)
 
 
-  
**Exclusive Gateway** – One path chosen based on condition [Exclusive Gateway Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/gateways/exclusive-gateway/)
 
 
-  
**Inclusive Gateway** – Multiple paths based on condition (limited support) *(Workarounds may be needed in Zeebe; not fully supported natively)*
 
 
-  
**Event-Based Gateway** – Waits for one of several events [Event-Based Gateway Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/gateways/event-based-gateway/)
 
 

  
### **3. Events Configuration**
 
Configure **Start, Intermediate, and End Events** using the following event types:
 
 
-  
**None Event** – Basic start or end
 
 
-  
**Error Event** – For error handling [Error Event Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/events/error-events/)
 
 
-  
**Escalation Event** – Not currently supported in Zeebe
 
 
-  
**Message Event** – Correlated by message name and key [Message Events Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/events/message-events/)
 
 
-  
**Signal Event** – Not supported in Zeebe
 
 
-  
**Timer Event** – Delays or scheduling [Timer Events Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/events/timer-events/)
 
 
-  
**Terminate Event** – Ends all process execution paths [Terminate Event Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/events/terminate-events/)
 
 

  
### **4. Subprocess Configuration**
 
 
- **Subprocess** – Embedded process inside a main process
 
- **Event Subprocess** – Triggered by events (interrupting or not)
 
- **Call Activity** – Calls a reusable BPMN process [Subprocesses Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/subprocesses/)
 

  
### **5. Multi-Instance Marker**
 
 
- Used to configure tasks to run in parallel or sequentially for collections [Multi-Instance Configuration Docs](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/modeler/bpmn/multi-instance/)

Here’s a beautified and structured prompt version of the configuration requirements for Camunda 8 BPMN processes, ideal for documentation, onboarding, or personal study:

Camunda 8 BPMN Developer Checklist

A Camunda 8 Developer should be proficient in configuring the following BPMN elements so they can be executed by the Zeebe engine:


---

1. Task Types

Configure the following tasks to enable proper execution in a Zeebe workflow:

User Task – Assign tasks to human users.

Service Task – Trigger external services or workers.

Send Task – (Handled via message throw events in Zeebe).

Receive Task – Use an Intermediate Message Catch Event instead.

Business Rule Task – Evaluate DMN decision tables.

Script Task – (Not natively supported; implement via service workers).



---

2. Gateway Types

Set up decision logic using:

Parallel Gateway – Executes all outgoing branches concurrently.

Exclusive Gateway – Executes one branch based on conditions.

Inclusive Gateway – Executes multiple branches (limited support in Zeebe).

Event-Based Gateway – Waits for one of several possible events to occur.



---

3. BPMN Events

Configure events as Start, Intermediate, or End types using:

None Event – Basic start or end event.

Error Event – Catch and handle process errors.

Escalation Event – (Not supported in Zeebe)

Message Event – Correlate messages with specific process instances.

Signal Event – (Not supported in Zeebe)

Timer Event – Implement delays or scheduled triggers.

Terminate Event – Immediately stop all process execution.



---

4. Subprocesses and Call Activities

Support modular, reusable, and interruptible logic through:

Subprocesses – Encapsulate part of a process.

Event Subprocesses – React to events, optionally interrupting the main flow.

Call Activities – Invoke reusable BPMN processes from other definitions.



---

5. Multi-Instance Configuration

Apply the multi-instance marker to tasks for:

Sequential or parallel repetition of tasks

Handling collections or looping structures
