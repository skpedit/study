To add BPMN error handling to a BPMN model, you typically use a Boundary Error Event attached to a Service Task. This allows the process to catch errors thrown from the Job Worker (e.g., INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD) and divert the flow accordingly.

Here's how to do it step by step:


---

1. Use Case

You have a service task like Validate Payment, and your Job Worker might throw a BPMN error such as INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD.


---

2. BPMN Diagram Logic

Basic structure:

[Start Event] → [Validate Payment (Service Task)] → [Process Payment] → [End Event]
                                 |
                                 +--> [Boundary Error Event: INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD] 
                                            |
                                            v
                                    [Notify Customer] → [End Event]


---

3. Camunda Modeler Setup

Step-by-step:

1. Select the Service Task (e.g., Validate Payment).


2. Right-click → Append → Boundary Event → Error Boundary Event.


3. Click on the boundary event and in the properties panel:

Set Error Code: INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD

Optionally set Name: Invalid Payment Handler



4. Connect the boundary event to a new task (e.g., Notify Customer).


5. End the error path with an End Event.

4. Example in BPMN XML (Simplified Snippet)

<bpmn:serviceTask id="ValidatePayment" name="Validate Payment" camunda:type="external" camunda:topic="validate-payment"/>
<bpmn:boundaryEvent id="ErrorBoundary" attachedToRef="ValidatePayment">
  <bpmn:errorEventDefinition errorRef="Error_InvalidPayment"/>
</bpmn:boundaryEvent>
<bpmn:error id="Error_InvalidPayment" errorCode="INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD" name="Invalid Payment"/>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow sourceRef="ErrorBoundary" targetRef="NotifyCustomer"/>
<bpmn:serviceTask id="NotifyCustomer" name="Notify Customer"/>


---

5. Summary

Error Code in the BPMN must match the error code thrown in your job worker (INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD).

You can create multiple boundary error events for different types of BPMN errors.

Camunda will automatically route the process via the error boundary path when a matching BPMN error is thrown.

Sure! Here's how you can add BPMN error handling to a Job Worker in both Node.js and Spring Boot (Java) for Camunda 8. This includes code examples and explanations of how BPMN errors are thrown and handled differently in each environment.

1. Spring Boot (Java) – BPMN Error Handling in Zeebe Job Worker

Dependencies

Add these to your pom.xml:

<dependency>
  <groupId>io.camunda</groupId>
  <artifactId>zeebe-spring-client</artifactId>
  <version>8.5.0</version>
</dependency>

Job Worker with BPMN Error

import io.camunda.zeebe.spring.client.annotation.JobWorker;
import io.camunda.zeebe.client.api.response.ActivatedJob;
import io.camunda.zeebe.client.api.worker.BpmnError;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class PaymentWorker {

    @JobWorker(type = "validate-payment")
    public void handleJob(final ActivatedJob job) {
        String paymentMethod = (String) job.getVariablesAsMap().get("paymentMethod");

        if ("invalid".equals(paymentMethod)) {
            throw new BpmnError("INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD", "The payment method is not supported.");
        }

        // Proceed with normal flow
    }
}

What it does:

Throws a BPMN error with code INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD if a business validation fails.

The error can be caught using a Boundary Error Event in the BPMN model.

2. Node.js – BPMN Error Handling in Zeebe Worker

Dependencies

Install Zeebe client:

npm install zeebe-node

Worker with BPMN Error

const { ZBClient, ZBErrorTypes } = require('zeebe-node');

const zbc = new ZBClient();

zbc.createWorker('validate-payment', async (job, complete, worker) => {
  const paymentMethod = job.variables.paymentMethod;

  if (paymentMethod === 'invalid') {
    return job.error('INVALID_PAYMENT_METHOD', 'The payment method is not supported.');
  }

  await complete.success();
});

What it does:

Calls job.error(errorCode, errorMessage) to throw a BPMN error to the process.

The process must have a Boundary Error Event configured to catch it.
