Here’s a quick guide on those Camunda Best Practices, especially focused on naming conventions and readable models:


---

1. Naming Conventions for BPMN IDs

Use consistent and meaningful IDs — especially helpful in scripts, APIs, and version control.

Format: Use lowerCamelCase or kebab-case

Good: approveRequest, send-email-notification

Avoid: Task_1, serviceTask123




---

2. Naming Events

Use clear, action-oriented names for events:

Start Event: processStarted, orderReceived

End Event: processCompleted, orderCancelled

Message/Event names: paymentConfirmed, userNotified


This helps collaborators understand what each event does at a glance.



---

3. Creating Readable Process Models

Keep it clean and simple:

Limit each process to a manageable number of tasks (~7-10)

Use sub-processes to break complex logic


Use consistent shapes and labels

Align elements properly for visual clarity

Add annotations where logic isn’t obvious

Make sure that process flow direction is left-to-right or top-down

These best practices make your BPMN diagrams easy to understand, maintain, and scale — especially when collaborating in teams or debugging in Operate.
