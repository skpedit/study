Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the **use cases** for each BPMN event type:

### **Intermediate Events**
- **Intermediate Throw Event**: Used to trigger an event within a process, such as sending a message or escalating an issue.
- **Message Intermediate Catch Event**: Waits for a message before proceeding, useful for external system interactions.
- **Message Intermediate Throw Event**: Sends a message to another process or system.
- **Timer Intermediate Catch Event**: Introduces a delay or waits for a specific time condition.
- **Escalation Intermediate Throw Event**: Escalates a process when predefined conditions are met.
- **Conditional Intermediate Catch Event**: Waits for a condition to be fulfilled before proceeding.
- **Link Intermediate Catch/Throw Event**: Connects different parts of a process model, useful for complex workflows.
- **Compensation Intermediate Throw Event**: Triggers compensation activities when a process needs to revert actions.
- **Signal Intermediate Catch/Throw Event**: Broadcasts or listens for signals across multiple processes.

### **End Events**
- **Message End Event**: Sends a final message before the process ends.
- **Escalation End Event**: Ends the process while escalating an issue.
- **Error End Event**: Terminates the process due to an error.
- **Cancel End Event**: Used in transaction subprocesses to cancel operations.
- **Compensation End Event**: Ensures compensation activities are completed before ending.
- **Signal End Event**: Broadcasts a signal when the process ends.
- **Terminate End Event**: Instantly stops all process activities.

### **Boundary Events**
- **Message Boundary Event**: Captures incoming messages while attached to an activity.
- **Timer Boundary Event**: Interrupts or delays an activity based on time conditions.
- **Escalation Boundary Event**: Handles escalations when attached to an activity.
- **Conditional Boundary Event**: Waits for a condition before proceeding.
- **Error Boundary Event**: Catches errors and redirects the process flow.
- **Cancel Boundary Event**: Cancels an activity in transaction subprocesses.
- **Signal Boundary Event**: Reacts to signals while attached to an activity.
- **Compensation Boundary Event**: Ensures compensation actions are executed.

### **Non-Interrupting Boundary Events**
- **Message, Timer, Escalation, Conditional, Signal Boundary Events (Non-Interrupting)**: Allows the process to continue while handling the event in parallel.
