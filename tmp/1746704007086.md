Sure! Here's a simple Node.js example of a Camunda Job Worker using the Zeebe Node.js client to connect to a Camunda 8 (Zeebe) engine.

1. Install Dependencies

npm install zeebe-node

2. Sample Job Worker Code

const { ZBClient } = require('zeebe-node');

// Create Zeebe client
const zbc = new ZBClient(); // Defaults to localhost:26500

// Register a Job Worker for 'payment-service'
zbc.createWorker({
  taskType: 'payment-service', // Job type defined in the BPMN model
  taskHandler: async (job, complete) => {
    try {
      console.log('Received job:', job.variables);

      // Simulate payment processing
      const paymentStatus = 'SUCCESS'; // This could be dynamic

      // Complete the job with new variables
      await complete.success({
        paymentStatus,
        message: 'Payment processed successfully',
      });
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Job failed', err);
      await complete.failure('Payment processing failed', 0); // 0 = no retries
    }
  },
  maxJobsToActivate: 5,
  timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
});

Key Features in the Example

Job Type: 'payment-service' â€“ matches the task type in your BPMN model.

Job Variables: Handled via job.variables.

Job Completion: Use complete.success() to finish the job.

Failure Handling: Use complete.failure() if something goes wrong.

Job Timeout and maxJobsToActivate: Set based on load and process sensitivity.
