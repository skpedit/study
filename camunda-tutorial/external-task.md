An **External Task** in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) within the context of Camunda is a task type used to delegate work to an external system or worker. It allows you to offload specific activities in a process to an external component, such as a microservice, an external script, or a custom application. These tasks are managed using the Camunda **External Task pattern**, enabling a decoupled and scalable approach to executing business logic.

### **Key Characteristics of External Tasks**
1. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - External tasks operate asynchronously, meaning the external worker polls for tasks to execute, processes them, and then notifies the engine when the task is completed.

2. **Pull-Based Mechanism**:
   - Unlike service tasks (which invoke services directly), external tasks rely on a **pull mechanism**, where external workers "fetch and lock" tasks from the Camunda engine.

3. **Decoupling**:
   - Business logic and process definitions are separated. This is useful in distributed systems where tasks are executed by external microservices or applications.

4. **Reliability**:
   - Built-in retry mechanisms and incident handling ensure tasks are not lost and failures can be handled systematically.

### **How External Tasks Work in Camunda**

1. **Task Definition in BPMN**:
   - The external task is defined in the BPMN model with a specific **topic name**. This topic is a label used to match external workers with tasks.
   
2. **Execution Process**:
   - External workers poll for tasks using the **Camunda REST API**.
   - Once a task is retrieved, the worker processes it and reports the status (success, failure, or BPMN error) back to Camunda.

3. **Workflow**:
   - **Process Execution**: Camunda reaches an external task in the process.
   - **Task Locked**: The external worker fetches and locks the task.
   - **Task Processing**: The worker performs the required operations (e.g., API call, computation).
   - **Task Completion**: The worker reports back to Camunda to mark the task as completed.

### **Defining an External Task in BPMN**
An external task is represented as a service task in BPMN with the `External` implementation type.

#### Example: BPMN Configuration
```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="ExternalTaskExample" name="External Task Example">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <camunda:type>external</camunda:type>
    <camunda:topic>payment-processing</camunda:topic>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
</bpmn:serviceTask>
```

- **`camunda:type`**: Specifies this is an external task.
- **`camunda:topic`**: Defines the topic name (`payment-processing`), which external workers use to fetch tasks.

---

### **External Task Lifecycle**

#### **1. Fetch and Lock**
External workers fetch tasks by polling the Camunda engine with a topic name.

**API Endpoint**:  
```
POST /external-task/fetchAndLock
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "workerId": "worker-123",
  "maxTasks": 5,
  "topics": [
    {
      "topicName": "payment-processing",
      "lockDuration": 60000  // Task locked for 60 seconds
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "Task_12345",
    "topicName": "payment-processing",
    "variables": {
      "amount": { "value": 1000, "type": "Integer" },
      "currency": { "value": "USD", "type": "String" }
    }
  }
]
```

#### **2. Task Processing**
The external worker performs the business logic using the provided variables.

#### **3. Complete Task**
Once processing is finished, the worker informs Camunda of the task completion.

**API Endpoint**:  
```
POST /external-task/{id}/complete
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "workerId": "worker-123",
  "variables": {
    "paymentStatus": { "value": "success", "type": "String" }
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "message": "Task completed successfully"
}
```

---

### **Error and Retry Mechanisms**
1. **Task Failure**:
   - If an error occurs, the worker reports the failure back to Camunda, specifying the retry count and backoff duration.

   **API Endpoint**:  
   ```
   POST /external-task/{id}/failure
   ```

   **Request:**
   ```json
   {
     "workerId": "worker-123",
     "errorMessage": "Service Unavailable",
     "retries": 3,
     "retryTimeout": 300000  // Retry after 5 minutes
   }
   ```

2. **BPMN Error**:
   - The worker can throw a BPMN error to trigger a boundary error event in the process.

   **API Endpoint**:  
   ```
   POST /external-task/{id}/bpmnError
   ```

   **Request:**
   ```json
   {
     "workerId": "worker-123",
     "errorCode": "PAYMENT_ERROR"
   }
   ```

### **Benefits of External Tasks**
1. **Scalability**:
   - Workers can be distributed across multiple nodes, scaling independently of the Camunda engine.
2. **Language Independence**:
   - External workers can be implemented in any language that supports REST APIs (e.g., Java, Python, Node.js).
3. **Flexibility**:
   - Decouples the process from the execution logic, making it easier to update or replace worker implementations.

### **Real-World Use Cases**
1. **Payment Processing**:
   - A payment gateway API is called by an external worker to process payments in an e-commerce workflow.
2. **Document Processing**:
   - A worker processes uploaded documents (e.g., OCR scanning, validation) in a business approval process.
3. **Third-Party Integration**:
   - External systems like CRM, ERP, or messaging services are invoked via workers.

### **Tools for External Tasks**
1. **Camunda External Task Client Libraries**:
   - Prebuilt clients in various languages (Java, Node.js, Python) simplify interaction with the Camunda API.
   - Example: [Camunda External Task Client (Java)](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-external-task-client-java)

2. **Monitoring in Camunda Cockpit**:
   - View running and locked external tasks.
   - Analyze incidents and retries for failed tasks.

By using **external tasks**, organizations can implement robust, decoupled, and scalable workflows while leveraging external systems to execute specialized tasks. This makes them ideal for modern distributed architectures and microservices.
