### **Signals in BPMN: Explanation, Use Cases, and Scenarios**

In **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)**, **signals** represent global events that can be used to broadcast information to one or more processes or participants. Signals are used to communicate across process boundaries, unlike messages that are directed towards a specific participant. A signal is a way to broadcast an event that can be received by multiple processes, tasks, or participants, making it a versatile tool for triggering actions or workflows.

### **Key Concepts Related to Signals in BPMN**

- **Signal Event**: Signals are represented as **Signal Events** in BPMN, which can be either **Start**, **Intermediate**, or **End** events.
  - **Signal Start Event**: This event triggers the start of a process or subprocess when a specific signal is received.
  - **Signal Intermediate Event**: This event waits for a specific signal to arrive, or it broadcasts a signal to other processes.
  - **Signal End Event**: This event sends a signal to other processes, signaling the end of a task or process.
  
- **Signal Flow**: Similar to message flows, but signals are broadcasted to multiple recipients, not just one.

- **Signal Scope**: Signals can be used globally within the same **BPMN model**. They are not tied to specific participants or processes.

### **Use Cases of Signals in BPMN**

#### **1. System-wide Notifications (Global Event Broadcast)**

**Scenario**:  
In a banking system, whenever a user initiates a **fraud alert** (e.g., unauthorized login or transaction), the system should broadcast a **fraud alert signal** to all processes that may require attention or action, such as user verification, account suspension, or internal investigations.

**Steps**:
1. The **Fraud Alert** process is triggered, and a **FraudAlertSignal** is broadcast.
2. Other processes, such as **Account Locking** or **Fraud Investigation**, wait for the **FraudAlertSignal** and take necessary actions.
3. Once the **FraudAlertSignal** is received, each process reacts by performing its respective tasks (locking the account, raising flags for investigation, etc.).

#### **BPMN Process Flow Representation**:

```json
{
  "bpmn:process": {
    "id": "FraudDetectionProcess",
    "name": "Fraud Detection",
    "bpmn:signalFlow": [
      {
        "sourceRef": "FraudAlertStartEvent",
        "targetRef": "AccountLockingProcess",
        "signalRef": "FraudAlertSignal"
      },
      {
        "sourceRef": "FraudAlertStartEvent",
        "targetRef": "FraudInvestigationProcess",
        "signalRef": "FraudAlertSignal"
      }
    ],
    "bpmn:signalEvent": {
      "id": "FraudAlertStartEvent",
      "name": "Fraud Alert Start",
      "signalRef": "FraudAlertSignal"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The **FraudAlertStartEvent** is a **Signal Start Event** that triggers the broadcasting of the **FraudAlertSignal** to multiple processes, such as **Account Locking** and **Fraud Investigation**.
- These processes will listen for the signal and react accordingly.

#### **2. Process Coordination Across Systems (Multiple Processes Acting Simultaneously)**

**Scenario**:  
In an order processing system, when an order is placed, multiple systems need to react. For example, the **inventory management system** needs to check the availability of items, the **shipping system** needs to allocate resources, and the **billing system** must charge the customer. These systems do not directly communicate with each other but react to the same **OrderReceivedSignal**.

**Steps**:
1. The **OrderReceivedSignal** is broadcast by the order placement process.
2. The **Inventory Management**, **Shipping**, and **Billing** processes wait for this signal.
3. Once the signal is received, each system performs the corresponding task (inventory check, resource allocation, or billing).

#### **BPMN Process Flow Representation**:

```json
{
  "bpmn:process": {
    "id": "OrderProcessingSystem",
    "name": "Order Processing",
    "bpmn:signalFlow": [
      {
        "sourceRef": "OrderReceivedStartEvent",
        "targetRef": "InventoryManagementSystem",
        "signalRef": "OrderReceivedSignal"
      },
      {
        "sourceRef": "OrderReceivedStartEvent",
        "targetRef": "ShippingSystem",
        "signalRef": "OrderReceivedSignal"
      },
      {
        "sourceRef": "OrderReceivedStartEvent",
        "targetRef": "BillingSystem",
        "signalRef": "OrderReceivedSignal"
      }
    ],
    "bpmn:signalEvent": {
      "id": "OrderReceivedStartEvent",
      "name": "Order Received Start",
      "signalRef": "OrderReceivedSignal"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The **OrderReceivedStartEvent** triggers the broadcasting of the **OrderReceivedSignal**.
- The **Inventory Management**, **Shipping**, and **Billing** systems are each waiting for the **OrderReceivedSignal** to trigger their respective actions.

#### **3. Workflow Suspension and Resumption (Coordinating Multiple Process States)**

**Scenario**:  
A business process might need to pause and wait for a specific condition or event to occur, such as waiting for **approval** from a manager before proceeding. Once the approval is granted, the process can resume. A **Signal** can be used to suspend the workflow until the approval signal is received.

**Steps**:
1. The process enters a **wait state** after reaching the **WaitForApproval** task.
2. The **Signal Intermediate Event** listens for a **ManagerApprovalSignal**.
3. When the manager grants approval, the **ManagerApprovalSignal** is sent, resuming the workflow.

#### **BPMN Process Flow Representation**:

```json
{
  "bpmn:process": {
    "id": "ApprovalProcess",
    "name": "Approval Process",
    "bpmn:signalFlow": [
      {
        "sourceRef": "ManagerApprovalSignalEvent",
        "targetRef": "WaitForApprovalTask",
        "signalRef": "ManagerApprovalSignal"
      }
    ],
    "bpmn:signalEvent": {
      "id": "ManagerApprovalSignalEvent",
      "name": "Manager Approval Signal",
      "signalRef": "ManagerApprovalSignal"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Explanation**:
- The **WaitForApprovalTask** suspends the workflow until it receives the **ManagerApprovalSignal**.
- Once the **ManagerApprovalSignal** is sent, the process is resumed, and the workflow continues to the next task.

### **Types of Signal Events in BPMN**

1. **Signal Start Event**:  
   This event triggers the start of a process or subprocess when it receives a specific signal. It is used to initiate actions or workflows across different processes or participants.
   
   **Example**: A **Signal Start Event** is used to start multiple parallel processes when an order is placed.

2. **Signal Intermediate Event**:  
   This event is used to either wait for a signal or broadcast a signal during the process. It can pause a process until a signal is received or send a signal to other processes.
   
   **Example**: A **Signal Intermediate Event** can wait for an **approval signal** or send a signal to trigger a subprocess.

3. **Signal End Event**:  
   This event is used to send a signal to other processes at the end of a task or process. It signifies that a specific condition has been met or that a task has been completed.
   
   **Example**: A **Signal End Event** might be used to notify other systems when a payment has been processed successfully.

### **Conclusion**

In BPMN, **signals** provide a powerful way to broadcast events across multiple processes or participants, enabling loose coupling between different parts of the system. Signals are used in scenarios where multiple processes need to react to the same event or where processes must pause and wait for an event before proceeding. By leveraging **Signal Start Events**, **Signal Intermediate Events**, and **Signal End Events**, BPMN allows businesses to model workflows that are reactive and adaptive to external or internal events.
